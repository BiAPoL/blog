# Marcelo Zoccoler

Hi! My name is Marcelo (not pronounced "Martchelo" in my case üòÜ) and I am an Electrical Engineer by formation, but also Life Sciences and Bio-Image Analysis aficionado!
I have always felt myself fluctuating between Engineering and Biology. Then I realized THAT could be exactly my place!
Still, I am formally an Engineer and not a Biologist, nor a Physicist, therefore most of my work has been done on tools and softwares for image analysis focused on microscopy data.
During my Masters and PhD in Biomedical Engineering, I have worked with measuring microtubules stiffness by image analysis and modeling in UJF (now Universit√© Grenoble Alpes) in France. Then, I have performed experiments with single cardiomyocytes under electrical fields in a fluorescence microscope that was assembled by our group at UNICAMP in Brazil. There, I started developing algorithms and softwares for bio-image analysis in MATLAB and Python! I also used a lot of Fiji as well for sure! The goals were to quantify calcium concentration and membrane potential in these cells. Most recently, I have contributed in the development of a software to analyze Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUV) data and an online simulator as a tool to teach students about electrochemical balance accross a semipermeable membrane.

Since 2021, as a researcher for the Bio-image Analysis Technology Development group (BiA-PoL) at the DFG Cluster of Excellence ‚ÄúPhysics of Life‚Äù at TU Dresden, I am developing courses and tools, mostly in Python and Fiji, that are intended to break down the barriers that biologists and biophysicists might experience when delving into the data science jungle. Below you will find some links to content related to my studies and how to find me.
