    "# Training a (YOLO) object detector using data from OMERO\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OMERO and YOLO in conjunction to train an object detector and classifier. But first off, before we start - all data used in this tutorial is [available on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13329153) under a CC-BY 4.0 license. Now to OMERO and YOLO - what are they and why are they useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "## OMERO\n",
    "\n",
    "[OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) - short for *open microscopy environment remote objects* is a widely used data management platform for image data in the life sciences. It allows you to store, organize, and analyze your images in a secure and scalable way. OMERO is open-source and can be easily extended and integrated with other tools and software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOLO\n",
    "\n",
    "[YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov10/) - short for *you only look once* is a class of continuously evolving object detection algorithms. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy and is widely used in computer vision applications. YOLO is open-source and has been implemented in many programming languages and frameworks. It can be used for a variety of applications such as object detection, object classification, tracking or pose estimation - but I think one of the most bread-and-butter applications is still object detection. Contrary to many common segmentation algorithms in bio-image analysis, it does not seek to classify every pixel, but rather to predict *bounding boxes* around objects of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This already brings forth one of the key advantages of using YOLO for bio-medical image segmentation, *especially* in instance segmentation problems: Pixel classification, without an additional post-processing step is unable to split pixels into different objects - YOLO does this very natively. A typical result of a YOLO model could look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "It all starts with a fresh environment. If you don't have Python installed on your machine installed yet, follow [this](ref:miniforge_python) tutorial by Mara Lampert to get everything up and running. You can omit the last step of the tutorial, as we will be creating a different environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, bring up your miniforge prompt and create a new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n omero-yolo python=3.9 ezomero tensorboard scikit-image tqdm ultralytics -c bioconda\n",
    "conda activate omero-yolo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Conda or mamba? If you are working with a fresh python installation done according to [the tutorial](ref:miniforge_python), then using conda will be fine. If you are using an older version and were used to mamba, you can use mamba instead of conda. The syntax is the same. You can upgrade your conda installation for conda to be as fast as mamba by following [these instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community). \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since training this kind of model is using deep learning, we will need to use a CUDA-capable (NVIDIA-manufactured) graphics card. Unfortunately, this is a key requirement for this tutorial. To install the necessary packages (i.e., [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)), run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "*Note*: The installation may differ depending on your OS or driver version. To make sure everything runs, update your drivers to the latest version and check out the pytorch-homepage for the [correct installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting data from omero\n",
    "\n",
    "Now where does OMERO come into play? Essentially, OMERO can serve as a super-easy tool to do annotations on your images - you can even do so collaboratively. In this example, the data we will work with, looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![OMERO data overview](./imgs/image2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "...and this is just a small snipped of the data. The entire dataset comprises more than 1500 images of this kind. What exactly we are looking at is not very important, but the job we'll want to do is essentially this: Detect different objects (cells and spheroids) in each image of a multi-well plate. For reference, these are the objects we are searching for:\n",

    "## Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to an important step, which one would like to avoid in deep learning if possible, but it's a necessary evil: Annotation. In this case, we will use OMERO to annotate the images. The simplest way to go at this in OMERO, is to just draw bounding boxes and write in the comment what sort of object it is. This is a very simple and straightforward way to do this. Unfortunately, OMERO does not (yet?) support simply tagging ROI (regions of interest) with labels, so we have to do this manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "![OMERO annotation](./imgs/annotate.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Still you can apprecciate that this is **much** faster than doing this in a local image viewer and then saving the annotations in a separate file, let alone annotating single pixels. Still, it's a bit cumbersome so the question of how much annotations are enough annotations naturally arises. Read more on the subject in the [respective section below](#how-much-training-data-is-enough?).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Consistency in the naming here is super-important. Make sure to stick to your conventions (i.e., avoid using \"cell\"/\"cells\"/\"Cell\" in the same dataset).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can actually proceed to train a model, we need to make the dataset available to us on our local machine. For this, we will use the excellent [ezomero package](https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/ezomero/index.html) you already installed. Let's write some code!"

    "- `batch`: Number of images in one batch. The bigger your GPU, the bigger this number can be. For a 8GB GPU, 64 is a good starting point.\n",
    "- `epochs`: Number of epochs to train the model. Longer training typically goes hand in hand with better performance, but also with [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).\n",
    "- `flipud`, `fliplr`, `degrees`: These parameters are used to augment the data. [Augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation) is a technique to artificially increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations (flipping, rotations, etc) to the images. This can help the model to generalize better and prevent overfitting. The values given for these parameters are the probabilities that the transformation is applied to an image.\n",
    "- `dropout`: Controls whether certain neurons (part of the neuronal network) are \"[dropped out](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/)\" (muted) during training, which corresponds to the network temporarily forgetting what it has learned. This can help to prevent overfitting as the network learns not to overly rely on certain neurons.\n",

    "You have seen that the syntax to set up the training for the yolo model is exceptionally easy, which is a huge strongpoint for yolo - not to mention that the model is quite fast and accurate. A grain of salt for using yolo is its AGPL license, which introduces quite strict requirements if you use it in your project. If you are planning to use yolo in a commercial project, you need to contact the developers for a proper license. For a more comprehensive overview of the licenses, check out [Robert Haase's slides on the subject](https://f1000research.com/slides/10-519).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How much training data is enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a question that is hard to answer. According to the [yolo docs on the subject](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/data-collection-and-annotation/#how-many-images-do-i-need-for-training-ultralytics-yolo-models), some 100 annotated images and training for 100 epochs can be enough to get started - consider annotating (order of magnitude) 1000s of images *per class* for a more robust model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one obvious downside to yolo: It works 2D only, and biological data can often be of arbitrary dimension (3D, multi-channel, timelapse, etc). However, YOLO can still be an interesting option for a variety of tasks in the biomedical context. Interesting applications can, for instance, arise in the context of high-throughput analysis in a smart-microscopy setup. In this case, a microscope may want to determine automatically whether it is worth keeping the data it acquired or not. To achieve this, maximum projections could be acquired and yolo used to determine whether the image contains interesting structures or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation of predicting bounding boxes is, well, the bounding box itself. Biological objects are typically not square. However, using results of a bounding box prediction, one could use [segment-anything](https://segment-anything.com/) to refine the prediction. For usage in bio-image analysis, make sure to check out [micro-sam](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/micro-sam/micro_sam.html). \n",
