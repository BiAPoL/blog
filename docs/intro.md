# Welcome!
Most of us study and work at the [Bio-image Analysis Technology Development group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/bia) at the [DFG Cluster of Excellence "Physics of Life" at the TU Dresden](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/).
We blog about image data science, knowledge exchange and research data management in the life sciences. The contents of this blog are licensed by the respective authors under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license unless a different license is specified.
