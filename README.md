# The BiA-PoL Blog
This repository contains a collection of blog posts explaining bio-image analysis to a broad audience, focusing on life-scientists. The content is available at

https://biapol.github.io/blog/

It is maintained using [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and build using [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).

Most of us study and work at the [Bio-image Analysis Technology Development group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/bia) at the [DFG Cluster of Excellence "Physics of Life" at the TU Dresden](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/).
We blog about image data science, knowledge exchange and research data management in the life sciences. The contents of this blog are licensed by the respective authors under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license unless a different license is specified.
