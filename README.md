# The BiA-PoL blog
Most of us study and work at the [Bio-image Analysis Technology Development group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/bia) at the [DFG Cluster of Excellence "Physics of Life" at the TU Dresden](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/). 
We blog about image data science, knowledge exchange and research data management in the life sciences.

Bio-image analysis is an emerging field. 
New technological developments in the middle ground between microscopy and data science emerge rapidly and new ways for processing image data change the way how we do research in biology and biophysics. 
As it is challenging to keep track of all the new developments...
