# The BiA-PoL blog
Most of us study and work at the [Bio-image Analysis Technology Development group](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/bia) at the [DFG Cluster of Excellence "Physics of Life" at the TU Dresden](https://physics-of-life.tu-dresden.de/). 
We blog about image data science, knowledge exchange and research data management in the life sciences.

## [Browsing the Open Microscopy Image Data Resource with Python](https://biapol.github.io/blog/browsing_idr)

For downloading images from the image data resource (IDR), you only need a link, e.g. for requesting the data in tif format. 
You can then use scikit-image to open the image. In this blog post we show how to browse the IDR programmatically in Python.

## [GPU-accelerated image processing in the cloud using Google Colab and clEsperanto](https://biapol.github.io/blog/clesperanto_google_colab)

Not every computer has a powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) and thus, 
it might make sense to use cloud computing, e.g. provided by Google. In this
blog post I give a short intro into Google Colab and how to enable
GPU-accelerated image processing in the cloud using clEsperanto

## [Why we blog](https://biapol.github.io/blog/why_we_blog)

Bio-image analysis is an emerging field. 
New technological developments in the middle ground between microscopy and data science emerge rapidly and new ways for processing image data change the way how we do research in biology and biophysics. 
As it is challenging to keep track of all the new developments...
